Hello everyone :)

I am Srijit Sen, and I had the pleasure (and occasional panic) of being an intern at Oasis Infobyte from June '24 to July '24. During this one month, I was assigned some tasks that showcased my web development skills and my design ideas. You know, the kind of tasks where you think, "I've got this," and then spend the next hour questioning your life choices because HTML and CSS decided to gang up on you. And just for fun, I threw in a little bit of JavaScript, because why not make things more chaotic?

Since this was my first internship, I had no idea how everyone else went about it. So naturally, I was given two beginner-friendly tasks to finish within a month. Beginner-friendly, they said. Piece of cake, they said. Well, let's just say the cake was a lie.

I won't bore you with the gritty details of what I did, but let's just say my learning curve resembled a roller coaster more than a gentle slope. I spent a lot of time on MDN and Dev.IO, frantically searching for answers to questions like, "Why is my div misbehaving?" and "What do you mean by ‘undefined’? It was fine five minutes ago!"

The best part? The environment was amazing. Everyone was ready to help, compete, and laugh at our collective misfortunes with code. It was like being in a sitcom where everyone is trying to create the best work possible while avoiding the dreaded "syntax error."

On my first day, I was thrilled and slightly terrified by what lay ahead. And what I got in the next month was a blend of excitement, confusion, and those "aha" moments that make all the struggles worth it.

In conclusion, this internship was a roller coaster of emotions, learning, and debugging sessions that I wouldn’t trade for anything. Here's to more coding adventures and figuring out how to center a div properly! 

Cheers :)
